## üõ§Ô∏è My Journey in Tech

My passion lies at the intersection of **health and technology**.

I began my professional journey as a **personal trainer** and earned a **Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Nutrition Science**. While working in the health space, I started building websites in **2014**, which sparked a deeper interest in **SEO**, **website performance**, and **UI optimization** to drive organic growth and engagement.

At the onset of the COVID pandemic, I pivoted fully into **software development**, driven by self-study, books, courses, and building personal projects. Since then, I‚Äôve completed **100+ private tutor hours** in software development and continued growing through hands-on experience.

Over the years, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work on impactful and large-scale projects including:
- **Flytoget** ‚Äì Norway‚Äôs airport express train service
- **Salita** ‚Äì A language services platform
- **iB√∏nn** and **iFaste** ‚Äì Islamic utility apps used by **10,000+ daily users**

I thrive in fast-paced environments, stay endlessly **curious**, and am committed to **continuous learning** as both a developer and a human.
