## My Journey in Tech

My passion lies at the intersection of **health and technology**.

I began my professional journey as a **personal trainer** and earned a **Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Nutrition Science**. While working in the health space, I started building websites in **2014**, which sparked a deeper interest in **SEO**, **website performance**, and **UI optimization** to drive organic growth and engagement.

At the onset of the COVID pandemic, I pivoted fully into software development, driven by self-study, books, courses, and building personal projects. Since then, I‚Äôve completed 100+ private tutor hours and have continued growing through hands-on experience. Along the way, I‚Äôve been fortunate to learn from and collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the industry, which has significantly accelerated my development and broadened my perspective.

Over the years, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work on impactful and large-scale projects including:
- **Flytoget** ‚Äì Norway‚Äôs premier airport express train and one of the country's most recognized brands.
- **Salita** ‚Äì One of Norway‚Äôs leading platforms for language and interpretation services.
- **iB√∏nn** and **iFaste** ‚Äì Among the most widely used Islamic apps in Scandinavia, with **10,000+ daily active users**.

I thrive in fast-paced environments, stay endlessly **curious**, and am committed to **continuous learning** as both a developer and a human.

# üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on ...
