# Hi there! I'm Michael ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub!

# About me
My name is Michael and I'm a front-end software developer with over 2000 hours of experience learning web development from Oslo, Norway. I started building websites at Universty in 2015 using Wordpress, but I didn't want my development journey to stop there so I went into front-end development. <br> <br> I am largely a self-taught front-end developer, and have learned through courses, books, videos, and most importantly... through trial and error. 
I have a passion for continous growth in the field and love the feeling of finding a solution to a problem.

MY favorite place I've been is Hawaii. I have been to 22 countries all over the world and was lucky to live a year as an exchange student in St. Louis, Missouri during the second year of high school. <br>
I love traveling and would love to work on some kind of travel app one day.
