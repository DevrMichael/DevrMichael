## üõ§Ô∏è My Journey in Tech

My passion lies at the intersection of **health and technology**.

I began my professional journey as a **personal trainer** and earned a **Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Nutrition Science**. While working in the health space, I started building websites in **2014**, which sparked a deeper interest in **SEO**, **website performance**, and **UI optimization** to drive organic growth and engagement.

At the onset of the COVID pandemic, I pivoted fully into software development, driven by self-study, books, courses, and building personal projects. Since then, I‚Äôve completed 100+ private tutor hours and have continued growing through hands-on experience. Along the way, I‚Äôve been fortunate to learn from and collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the industry, which has significantly accelerated my development and broadened my perspective.

Over the years, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work on impactful and large-scale projects including:
- **Flytoget** ‚Äì Norway‚Äôs airport express train service
- **Salita** ‚Äì A language services platform
- **iB√∏nn** and **iFaste** ‚Äì Islamic utility apps used by **10,000+ daily users**

I thrive in fast-paced environments, stay endlessly **curious**, and am committed to **continuous learning** as both a developer and a human.

# üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on ...

- Deepening my knowledge of **React Native** to build seamless, high-quality mobile experiences
- Expanding my backend expertise by building scalable APIs and services with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB
- Implementing **WebSocket-based** real-time features in apps (e.g. live updates, ticketing systems)
- Exploring how real-time tech can improve user experience, especially in apps with high engagement or critical timing
