# Hi there! I'm Michael ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Michael and I'm a front-end software developer with over 2000 hours of experience learning web development from Oslo, Norway. I started building websites at 'Universitetet i Agder' in 2015 using Wordpress, but I didn't want my development journey to stop there so I went into front-end development. <br> <br> I am largely a self-taught front-end developer, and have learned through courses, books, videos, and most importantly... through trial-and-error. 
I have a passion for continous growth in the field and love the feeling of finding a solution to a problem.
